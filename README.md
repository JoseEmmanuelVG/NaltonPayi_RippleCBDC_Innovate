## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from Mexica mythology, where "PayNalton" means "small fast runner." Nalton was responsible for efficiently delivering messages and conducting remote transactions by running from one point to another.

## What it does

"Nalton Paiy" is an automated transaction and financial content generator utilizing smart programs on the XRP Ledger. With artificial intelligence, users can perform transfers, payments, CBDC swaps, generate AI descriptions/images of purchases, access loans, tokenize small stores, messaging, check transaction history, asset prices, and more.

## How we built it

The project includes a landing page with project information, a mobile UI mockup, and a web application:

- **NALTON_WALLET** (Web Application)
  - Utilizes technologies like XRPL (XRP Ledger), Xumm Wallet, Smart Contracts, XRPL APIs, OpenAI APIs, and more.
  - Includes components such as transaction summary, wallet browser (using basic AI for transaction detection), local wallet modals, and more.
  - Backed by a Node.js backend with MongoDB for storing encrypted XRPL testnet account information.
  - Implements features for saving addresses and keys, making transactions through text input, viewing transaction history, and generating images for transactions.
  - Implements wallet connectivity for XRPL and Metamask.

## Challenges we ran into

Some challenges faced during the project include integrating various technologies, ensuring secure storage of sensitive data, and implementing complex financial features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating an automated financial content generator with AI-driven transaction processing and integration with the XRP Ledger is a significant accomplishment. Developing features like CBDC swaps, tokenization, and secure transaction history tracking also adds value to the application.

## What we learned

Through this project, the team learned about integrating different technologies, utilizing smart programs on the XRP Ledger, and leveraging AI for transaction generation and content creation. Additionally, the team gained insights into secure storage practices for sensitive financial data.

## What's next for Nalton Paiy

The future of Nalton Paiy involves further refining the application, expanding its compatibility with different wallet connectors, and exploring integration with the Ripple CBDC Innovate Payment Service and international banking networks. The team also plans to enhance security, improve user experience, and potentially migrate to a more comprehensive cloud solution like Azure Cosmos DB.
